NLP in the Stock Market,Leveraging sentiment analysis on 10-k fillings. 10-k forms are annual reports filed by companies to provide a comprehensive summary of their financial performance (these reports are mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission). Combing through these reports is often tedious for investors. Through sentiment analysis, a subfield of natural language processing, investors can quickly understand if the tone of the report is positive, negative, or litigious etc. The overall sentiment expressed in the 10-k form can then be used to help investors decide if they should invest in the company.
